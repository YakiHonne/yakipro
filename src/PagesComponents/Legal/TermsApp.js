      </h2>
      <p>
        This EULA is concluded solely between You (the end user) and JUSTHONNE
        TECHNOLOGY SDN BHD, and <strong>not with Apple Inc. ("Apple")</strong>.
        JUSTHONNE TECHNOLOGY SDN BHD, not Apple, is solely responsible for the

        2. Scope of License
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Company grants You a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive,
        revocable license to use the App on any Apple-branded products that You
        own or control, and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the
        Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions. This license does not allow
        You to use the App on any device that You do not own or control, and You
        may not distribute or make the App available over a network where it
        could be used by multiple devices at the same time. The App may be
        accessed and used by other accounts associated with the purchaser via
        Family Sharing or volume purchasing.
      </p>

      <h2 id="conduct" data-legal-heading>

      </h2>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>

      <p>
        The Company has zero tolerance for objectionable content or abusive users
        and reserves the right to remove content and/or terminate accounts that

      </p>

      <h2 id="content" data-legal-heading>
        4. User Content &amp; Intellectual Property
      </h2>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for any content You upload, share, or publish
        through the App. The Company disclaims any liability for user-generated
        content and reserves the right to moderate, remove, or disable content
        that violates these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Company retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the App,
        including its intellectual property. These Terms do not grant You any
        rights to use YakiPro&rsquo;s trade names, trademarks, service marks,
        logos, or other distinctive brand features.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event of any third-party claim that the App or Your possession and
        use of the App infringes that third party&rsquo;s intellectual property
        rights, JUSTHONNE TECHNOLOGY SDN BHD, <strong>not Apple</strong>, will be
        solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and
        discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.
      </p>

      <h2 id="support" data-legal-heading>
        5. Maintenance and Support
      </h2>
      <p>
        JUSTHONNE TECHNOLOGY SDN BHD is solely responsible for providing any
        maintenance and support services with respect to the App. You and the
        Company acknowledge that <strong>Apple has no obligation whatsoever</strong>{" "}
        to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.
      </p>

      <h2 id="subscriptions" data-legal-heading>
        6. Subscriptions
      </h2>
      <p>
        YakiPro offers subscription plans (currently: Free, Basic, Premium) that
        unlock additional publishing, analytics, and AI writing tools.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Free trial</strong>: New users may receive a 7-day free trial
          of the Basic plan. The Company may, at its sole discretion, grant,
          extend, withhold, or decline to grant a trial to any user.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Price changes</strong>: The Company may change subscription
          prices at any time. If a price changes, any active subscription under
          the old price will continue until the end of its current billing
          period; continued access thereafter requires the user to resubscribe
          under the new pricing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Renewal notices</strong>: For all payment methods, the Company
          will show in-app messages on three consecutive days before a
          subscription renews or is cancelled/expires.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="payment-methods" data-legal-heading>
        7. Payment Methods
      </h2>
      <table className="legal-doc-table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Method</th>
            <th>How it works</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Stripe Checkout (web)</td>
            <td>
              Card payment completed entirely on Stripe's hosted checkout page;
              card cancellation and resumption are supported in-app.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Lightning invoice (QR code)</td>
            <td>
              Payment is made outside the App using the user's own Lightning
              wallet and verified by the Company's server once settled. No in-app
              cancel button; the subscription is simply not renewed and access
              ends at period end.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2 id="cancellation" data-legal-heading>
        8. Cancellation
      </h2>
      <p>
        Subscriptions paid by card support explicit in-app cancellation and
        resumption at any time before the period ends. Subscriptions paid via
        Lightning do not have an explicit cancellation control, since there is no
        stored payment method to charge again; they simply expire automatically
        at the end of the paid period unless a new invoice is paid.
      </p>

      <h2 id="yaki-points" data-legal-heading>
        9. Yaki Points

        reactions, zaps, and other qualifying actions) and reflect a user's level
        and standing. They have no cash value, cannot be purchased, transferred,
        or exchanged for cash, and are not a means of payment for subscriptions
        or any other feature of the App.

        of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
        non-infringement. The Company does not warrant that the App will be
        error-free or uninterrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, JUSTHONNE TECHNOLOGY

        You. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have
        no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any
        other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses
