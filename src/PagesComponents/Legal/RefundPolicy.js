      <h2 id="intro" data-legal-heading>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This Refund Policy explains when a payment made to YakiPro, operated by Yakihonne
        LLC, may be refunded. It applies to all subscription plans and should be read together
        with the Terms and Conditions.
      </p>

      <h2 id="no-refunds" data-legal-heading>No refunds for change of mind</h2>
      <p>
        All payments — regardless of payment method (Stripe Checkout or Lightning) — are
        final. The Company does not issue refunds because a user changes their mind, no
        longer wants a subscription, or did not use a plan they paid for.
      </p>

      <h2 id="exception" data-legal-heading>Platform error exception</h2>
      <p>
        A refund will be issued only when a payment resulted in a loss of money with no
        corresponding value received, because of an error on YakiPro's platform — for
        example, a payment settled but the subscription it paid for was never granted. In
        that case, the Company will refund the payment (including via a Lightning payment
        back to the user, where the original payment was made via Lightning) or grant the
        entitlement that should have been received, whichever the user prefers.
      </p>

      <h2 id="table" data-legal-heading>By payment type</h2>
      <table className="legal-doc-table">
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Payment type</th><th>Refund rule</th></tr>

          <tr>
            <td>Subscription — Stripe Checkout (card)</td>
            <td>Not refundable except under the platform-error exception above. Where applicable, refunds are issued by Stripe back to the original payment method.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Subscription — Lightning</td>
            <td>Not refundable except under the platform-error exception above.</td>

      <h2 id="request" data-legal-heading>How to request a refund</h2>
      <p>
        To report a platform error that resulted in a loss of money without receiving the
        corresponding value, contact the Company either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>via direct message to the official YakiHonne Nostr account, or</li>
        <li>by email at <span className="legal-doc-code">info@yakihonne.com</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Include the relevant transaction details (payment method, amount, date, and what was
        expected but not received). The Company will review each report against the rule
        above.
      </p>
