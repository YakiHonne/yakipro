      <h2 id="intro" data-legal-heading>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how Yakihonne LLC ("the Company", "We", "Us", "Our")
        collects, uses, and discloses information when You use the YakiPro application
        (the "Service"), and explains Your privacy rights. By using the Service, You agree
        to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy.
      </p>

      <h2 id="definitions" data-legal-heading>Definitions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Company</strong> refers to Yakihonne LLC, 140 East Broadway, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, United States.</li>
        <li><strong>Country</strong> refers to: United States (Wyoming).</li>
        <li><strong>Application / Service</strong> refers to YakiPro, the software provided by the Company.</li>
        <li><strong>Account</strong> means a unique account created for You to access the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Yaki Points</strong> means the non-monetary, in-app engagement points earned by interacting with the Service, as described in the Terms and Conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Provider</strong> means a third party that processes data on the Company's behalf to help provide the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>You</strong> means the individual or entity accessing or using the Service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="data-collected" data-legal-heading>Data we collect</h2>

      <h3>Account &amp; Content Data</h3>
      <p>
        Your Nostr public key, profile metadata, and the content You create, publish, or
        draft within the Service (articles, notes, and related media), which is needed to
        provide the Service's publishing, analytics, and AI writing features.
      </p>

      <h3>Payment &amp; Subscription Data</h3>
      <p>
        Subscription plan, billing status, renewal date, and payment method used (card via
        Stripe, or Lightning). The Company does not receive, process, or store card numbers,
        billing addresses, or identity documents: card payments are completed entirely on
        Stripe's hosted Checkout page, and Stripe performs any identity or KYC verification
        independently of the Company.
      </p>

      <h3>Lightning Payment Data</h3>
      <p>
        For Lightning-based payments, the Company receives and verifies a Lightning
        invoice/payment confirmation from its own node or payment processor; the underlying
        wallet used to pay is external to the Service and outside the Company's control.
      </p>

      <h3>Google Account Data</h3>
      <p>
        If You choose to sign in with Google, authentication is handled through the Company's
        Pomegranate login flow. The Company receives only the authentication token issued by
        Pomegranate's central server and Your email address from Google — no other Google
        profile data is received. On first sign-in, a Nostr key pair is generated for Your
        Account; on subsequent sign-ins, if a remote signer ("bunker") has already been set
        up, a bunker URL is used to sign events instead of exposing a private key to the
        Company.
      </p>

      <h2 id="data-use" data-legal-heading>How we use it</h2>
      <p>The Company uses collected data to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Service, including publishing, analytics, and AI writing tools;</li>
        <li>Manage Your Account and registration;</li>
        <li>Process, verify, grant, renew, downgrade, or cancel subscriptions and payments;</li>
        <li>Send renewal and billing-related notices;</li>
        <li>Detect and prevent fraud or abuse of the Service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="data-sharing" data-legal-heading>Sharing of your information</h2>
      <p>The Company shares information only as needed to operate the Service:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stripe, Inc.</strong> — as the Company's payment processor for card-based Checkout sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Lightning Network infrastructure/providers</strong> — solely to verify that a Lightning invoice issued to You has been paid.</li>
        <li><strong>Google / Pomegranate</strong> — for authentication purposes only, when You choose Google Sign-In; limited to Your email address and an authentication token.</li>
        <li><strong>With other users</strong> — content You post or publish through the Service, consistent with the public and pseudonymous nature of the Nostr protocol.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Company does not sell Your Personal Data.</p>

      <h2 id="rights" data-legal-heading>Your rights</h2>
      <p>
        You may update, amend, or delete Your account information at any time through Your
        account settings, or by contacting Us. Depending on where You reside, You may have
        additional rights under US state privacy laws (such as the right to know, delete, or
        opt out of certain uses of Your data). To exercise these rights, contact Us using the
        details below.
      </p>

      <h2 id="children" data-legal-heading>Children's privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. The Company does not
        knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 13. If You are a parent or guardian
        aware that Your child has provided Us with personal data, please contact Us so it can
        be removed.
      </p>

      <h2 id="changes" data-legal-heading>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes are posted on this page
        and the "Last updated" date above is revised accordingly. You are advised to review
        this Policy periodically.
